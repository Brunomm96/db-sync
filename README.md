ðŸ“„<br>Database Synchronization Service
</h1>

## About

> Service that, given the connection and which tables to sync, will retrieve all data and populate the host`s database.

## Deployment
> The service is deployed as a Windows Service, using `Java Servive Wrapper` with `winsw`.

* First build the project running the following command in the intellij ideia terminal:

```
./gradlew build
```
> This will create a .jar file at the project path `/build/libs`.

* After, get the Windows Service template at the repository path `/deploy/windows` and copy all the contents to a separated folder, replacing the .jar file with the one generated by the build at the first step (It`s important that the .jar file name is the same as the old .jar contained in the template).

* Then, configure the XML file with the host`s database information.

* Finnaly, just run the `deploy.bat` file and the Windows Service will be created.
